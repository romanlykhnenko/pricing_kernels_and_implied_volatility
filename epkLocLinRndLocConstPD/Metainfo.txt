Description : 'Estimates and plots (yearly) empirical pricing kernels (EPK), risk neutral densities (RND) and physical densities (PD) of DAX
30 index return conditional on 20% (red curve), 40% (green curve) and 60% (blue curve) quantiles of volatility index VDAX-NEW (current year),
and time to maturity 1 month. Local linear kernel regression is used for estimation of the conditional risk neutral density and local constant
kernel regression is used for estimation of conditional physical density. Moreover, 95% confidence intervals have been calculated for PK, RND
and PD conditioned by 40% quantile of VDAX-NEW and time to maturity 1 month. All results are shown on a continuously compounded 1-month period
returns scale. '
